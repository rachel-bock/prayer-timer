// Open the app.  Display a splash screen.

// Allow user to login using Facebook or Google login information or continue as a guest in demo mode.

// Demo mode - 
// Give a timer for preparing to pray. 
// Display a clock with sections for each part of the prayer process.
// Have a button that starts the clock.
// Have a button that pauses the clock.
// Have a paragraph that provides a description about what the prayer section is referring to.
//   In the paragraph, give examples of what to say during this section of the prayer.
// When the prayer timer gets to the end of a section, the timer will ding and ask the client if they want to continue to the next section of the prayer.  If so, they continue.
// If not, they will be (in effect) pausing the timer until they are ready to continue.
// When the prayer is done, remind client to write down thoughts and impressions of the prayer.
// Allow the capability to reset the timer to the first section as necessary.  (Sometimes, it is necessary to start a prayer over in the middle of a prayer.)
